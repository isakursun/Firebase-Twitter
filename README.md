<h1> Twitter </h1>

This project is a Twitter clone application that encompasses basic features. Using JavaScript, React, and Google Firebase, I created an application where users can sign in with their Google accounts. After logging in, they can share text and photo content, edit or delete the content they've shared. Additionally, users can like posts made by other users.
